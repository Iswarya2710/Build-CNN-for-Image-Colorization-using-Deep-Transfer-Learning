# Build-CNN-for-Image-Colorization-using-Deep-Transfer-Learning

# Overview
This project is a demonstration of image colorization using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and deep transfer learning. It leverages pre-trained models to efficiently colorize grayscale images, adding vibrance and context to them.

# Requirements
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook (for running example notebooks)
Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, numpy, matplotlib, and any other relevant libraries.
